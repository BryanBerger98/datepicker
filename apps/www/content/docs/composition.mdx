## Introduction to composition

If you use components libraries like [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), you should already know what composition is. It's the ability to use multiple components together to create new ones.

The advantage of composition is that it allows you to create multiple different components that share the same core logic and to give them different behaviors and styles.

To know more about composition, you can read [this article](https://frontendmastery.com/posts/advanced-react-component-composition-guide/) by [Frontend Mastery](https://frontendmastery.com).

## Example

Let's say you want to create a calendar with a header and a body. Most of the libraries will provide you a `Calendar` component that will render both the header and the body. But what if you dont want the header ? Or what if you want to add a footer?

With [Datepicker](https://datepicker.bryanberger.dev), you can create a customer `Calendar` component that will use the `Header`, `Content` and `Grid` or the main `Calendar` component.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { Calendar } from '@bryanberger/datepicker';

const MyDatePicker = () => {

	return (
		<Calendar
			className="border rounded-md p-3"
		>
			<Calendar.Header>
				<Calendar.Title />
			</Calendar.Header>
			<Calendar.Content>
				<Calendar.Grid />
			</Calendar.Content>
		</Calendar>
	);
};

export default MyDatePicker;
```

Notice that we added a `Title` too but it's not required. You can use the `Calendar.Header` component with **any children you want**.

I am sure you begin to see the advantage of composition here.

You can also add weekdays to your calendar by using the `Head` component inside the `Content`.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { Calendar } from '@bryanberger/datepicker';

const MyDatePicker = () => {

	return (
		<Calendar
			className="border rounded-md p-3"
		>
			<Calendar.Header>
				<Calendar.Title />
			</Calendar.Header>
			<Calendar.Content>
				<Calendar.Head />
				<Calendar.Grid />
			</Calendar.Content>
		</Calendar>
	);
};

export default MyDatePicker;
```

## Styling

The `Calendar` component is a composition of multiple components. It means that you can style each component individually.

```tsx showLineNumbers
import { Calendar } from '@bryanberger/datepicker';

const MyDatePicker = () => {

	return (
		<Calendar
			className="border rounded-md p-3"
		>
			<Calendar.Header className="bg-gray-100">
				<Calendar.Title className="text-gray-700" />
			</Calendar.Header>
			<Calendar.Content>
				<Calendar.Grid className="bg-gray-100" />
			</Calendar.Content>
		</Calendar>
	);
};
```
